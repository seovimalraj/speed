### Performance Issues
- Start with "Basic" optimization level
- Exclude problematic files in Advanced settings
- Clear cache after making changes

### PageSpeed Test Timeouts
- If you see "RPC::DEADLINE_EXCEEDED: context deadline exceeded" errors, this usually indicates the website being tested is very slow or Google's servers are busy
- The plugin now automatically retries failed tests with exponential backoff
- Tests have increased timeouts (up to 3 minutes) to handle slow websites
- If tests consistently fail, try testing during off-peak hours or check if the website URL is accessible

### Compatibility
- Test optimizations on staging environment first
- Some themes/plugins may conflict with aggressive optimization
- Use exclude files option for compatibility
